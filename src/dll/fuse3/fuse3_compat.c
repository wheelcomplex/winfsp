/*
 * This file provides an implementation of the `fuse3_*` symbols. This
 * implementation is a simple shim that forwards `fuse3_*` calls to the
 * equivalent `fsp_fuse3_*` ones using a default `fsp_fuse_env`.
 *
 * These symbols should *not* be used by C/C++ programs. For this reason
 * the `fuse.h` headers only expose the `fsp_fuse3_*` symbols, wrapped
 * with macros. These symbols are for use only from programs using FFI
 * technology to access FUSE symbols (e.g. fusepy, jnr-fuse).
