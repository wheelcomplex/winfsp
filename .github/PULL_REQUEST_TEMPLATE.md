Before submitting this PR please review this checklist. Ideally all checkmarks should be checked upon submitting. (Use an x inside square brackets like so: [x])

- [ ] **Contributing**: You MUST read and be willing to accept the [CONTRIBUTOR AGREEMENT](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp/blob/master/Contributors.asciidoc). The agreement gives joint copyright interests in your contributions to you and the original WinFsp author. If you have already accepted the [CONTRIBUTOR AGREEMENT](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp/blob/master/Contributors.asciidoc) you do not need to do so again.
- [ ] **Topic branch**: Avoid creating the PR off the master branch of your fork. Consider creating a topic branch and request a pull from that. This allows you to add commits to the master branch of your fork without affecting this PR.
- [ ] **No tabs**: Consistently use SPACES everywhere. NO TABS, unless the file format requires it (e.g. Makefile).
- [ ] **Style**: Follow the same code style as the rest of the project.
- [ ] **Tests**: Include tests to the extent that it is possible, especially if you add a new feature.
- [ ] **Quality**: Your design and code should be of high quality and something that you are proud of.
